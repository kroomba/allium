look at the game... don't ruin it for anyone
- Updated Vol. 3 music tracks. Certain instruments in certain songs were placeholders so I updated those.
- Aside from that... see you when Vol. 1 Official Demo launches later this year...

- Touched up Candyland, Crib, Blub and Huxley tilemaps.
- Added missing "walking" animations

Version 0.32

Version 0.31
- fixed bugs and typos for Vol. 3

Version 0.30 - Volume 3
- Added the main story and battles of Volume 3.
- (as with the other 2 volumes: I have plans to make the game less linear, as right now I have been focusing on programming in the major story beats and the major battles, hence why the demos are pretty barebones in terms of exploration and side content. After the major parts throughout the entire game are programmed, I will go back and add exploration, side quests, mini-games, etc. like a true RPG.)
- Adjusted some sprites from previous volumes.

Version 0.25
- Added dialogue to battles! When you select Attack, there is now dialogue between Allium and the opponent, leaving more opportunity to get to know the characters before you uh defeat them. Essentially, its new story content seamlessly woven into the original Vol. 1 and 2. If you die and have to repeat a battle, you can hold X to skip through the dialogue.
- Speaking of skipping dialogue, you can now press X to fast forward dialogue throughout the game! You should still read the dialogue tho its fyre trust me bro.
- The game over screen has been updated, Mallium now has randomized different dialogue talking smack about how bad you are at the game.
- The title screen music is updated to the one from the Vol. 4 OST, as opposed to the annoying looping one from before.
- The placeholder Undertale Intro sound effect was replaced with a new original sound.
- The hit/damage sound effect in battles has been lowered in volume to not overwhelm the background music.
- Noise is disabled by default. 
- Text has been updated throughout the game, fixing small typos here and there.
